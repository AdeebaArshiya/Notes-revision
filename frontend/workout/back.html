        <h1>Back & Shoulder Workout</h1>

        <h2>Warm-Up for back & shoulder Exercises</h2>
        <p>Before jumping into back & shoulder workouts, it’s important to warm up your body. A good warm-up increases blood flow, loosens your muscles, and gets your core ready to work harder while reducing the risk of injury. Start with 3–5 minutes of light cardio, like jogging in place or jumping jacks, to raise your heart rate. Then, add some dynamic stretches such as torso twists, standing side bends, or high knees to activate your core. This short routine will prepare your abs and make your workout more effective.</p>
