    <h2>Your Fat-Burning Routine: What to Do Before and After Exercise</h2>
    <p>
        Before your workout, it’s important to prepare your body. A light warm-up and stretching get your muscles ready, boost blood flow, and prevent injuries. Eating something small and balanced, like fruit or a handful of nuts, can give you the right energy to perform better.    </p>
   
    <p>After your workout, your body needs recovery. Cooling down with stretches helps relax your muscles and reduce soreness. Drinking water keeps you hydrated, and a protein-rich snack or meal supports muscle repair and keeps your metabolism active, which is key for fat loss.</p>
    
    <p>Consistency in both pre- and post-workout habits will not only help you burn fat but also keep you healthier, stronger, and more energized every day</p>
